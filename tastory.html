		<br>
		<h3>Useful Skills</h3>
		<table>
		<tr><td>Cluster Bomb</td><td>Blast smokescreen for stealth</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Blinding Powder</td><td>Stealth for 3 seconds, 40 sec cool down</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Smoke Screen</td><td>Blinds and if you blast it, you can party stealth if everyone is stacked</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Shadow Refuge</td><td>Party stealth</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Trick Shot</td><td>Arrows bounce so this is useful in targetting the deadly blossoms that spawn</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Infiltrator's Arrow</td><td>Shadow step around with shortbow</td></tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		<h3>Extra Notes</h3>
		<p>If you happen to be using my <a href="dungeonskills.html"> dungeon build</a> entering stealth is a good way to condi remove and protect your party during the run. Stun breaks are listed above to be used for gravelings.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough</h3>
		<h4>Pods</h4>
		<p>Skip through this section and stealth your party across. Don't open any of the pods because </p><br>
		
		<h4>Spider Queen</h4>
		<p>Keep an eyeball out for any blossoms in the area, they cause poison if you near them and they explode. Stay away from her face to avoid her Bite attack. If she starts to glow, dodge or block if you can. She will wrap you in a web and immobilize you for a really long time. </p><br>
		
		<h4>Room with Spell Blossoms</h4>
		<p>Destroy all the Spell Blossoms in the area and kill the Knight standing in the middle. If other enemies spawn, kill those too.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Sariel</h4>
		<p>Use the ledges and stay on top of them when you can if Sariel is on the floor below. She has an extremely strong Dash attack and she likes to single out party members. Keep your distance as best as you can and if her Defiance bar breaks, go in and melee her down.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Lake of Fear</h4>
		<p>Go to the 3 different areas in the map to collect the items that Caithe needs to rebuild the bridge. There are patrols scattered the area and they can be easily avoided by skirting around the edges. The Mutated Fish spawns Barracudas so if you down, kill those to rally.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Brangoire</h4>
		<p>This enemy summons Living Nightmares which is this transparent minion. Stay mobile as much as possible because these minions will explode with poison. Equip condition removal or stealth to remove it. </p><br>
		
		<h4>Cadeyrn</h4>
		<p>Meleeing him is highly recommended as he reflects projectiles when he casts on party members. (It will look like a shiny bubble is around you. ) Occasionally, he might turn a party member into a kitten. If that is the case, look at the edges of the room for a Nightmare Pup and kill it to regain your usual form.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Nursery</h4>
		<p>Open the pods to kill the Elite inside. Make sure to open the pods one-by-one so you don't get swamped with enemies. The Elite inside may drop Volatile Essences, these must be thrown at the Husk to make it vulnerable. You need to do it 4 times. Once the Husk is vulnerable, DPS him down. He's got a lot of knock back and launches so look out when he starts glowing and get ready to dodge.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Killing Faolain and the Destiny's Edge Clones</h4>
		<p>Kill the clones in this order: Eir, Zojja, Rytlock or Logan. Eir s the most dangerous so make sure to knock her out first. Once you kill one of the clones, Faolain will come down from her perch and you can attack her. Be sure to attack her so that she won't revive the clones and keep doing so to interrupt her. Kill the remaining clones and Faolain will become completely vulnerable for attack.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Dungeon Complete</h4>
		<p>Congratulations! You have completed this dungeon!</p><br>
