		<h2>Explorable Mode Guide</h2>
		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough: Detha's Path</h3> <br>
		
		<h4>Defend Detha in spike room</h4>
		<p>Here, you have to defend Detha for a certain amount of time until a Champion Graveling spawns. There are spike traps on the floor to kill the flood of enemies that will start. There are 5 trap triggers used to start the spike traps on the floor. Don't worry, your party members will not be hurt.<br>
		Have a couple party members operate the traps to kill the little gravelings that come up and the rest will be on the floor DPSing. Dagger storm is incredibly useful and use stealth if you need to switch out or res any of your other party members.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Going to Ghost Eater</h4>
		<p>Use the Kholer way point and go up the stairs. Disable the traps by pulling on the chain on the left. Kill all the mobs around the surrounding area so Detha can safely enter the boss room.</p><br>
	
		<h4>Protect Detha</h4>
		<p>Defend Detha while she builds the traps for Ghost Eater. As Detha is working on a trap, enemies will spawn and you will have to protect her. The rotation goes south-west, west, and north-west. <br>
		Note: if Detha feels safe, she will move onto the next trap even if you haven't killed all the enemies that spawned. Make sure to keep an eye on her. </p><br>
		
		<h4>Ghost Eater</h4>
		<p>Ghost Eater is protected by his Ghost Shield which makes him completely invulnerable. Pulling him into a trap will disable the shield so you can DPS him. 
		<br>
		First charge at least 2 traps with the oozes that will spawn. Pick up the rifle, press 1 on the boss to spawn the oozes. Target an ooze, press 1 to lift it into the air, and ask your party members to press 2 and direct the ooze to the trap. Each trap needs 3 oozes. <br>
		Once 2 traps have been charged. Pull Ghost Eater and start your attack. <br>
		Don't panic if his Ghost Shield goes up again, coordinate with your group and pull him over to the second trap you charged to break his shield and DPS.</p><br>
	
		<h4>Dungeon Complete</h4>
		<p>Congratulations! You have completed the dungeon!</p><br>
