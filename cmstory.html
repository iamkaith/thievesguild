		<h3>Extra Notes</h3>		
		<p>
		If you happen to be using my <a href="dungeonskills.html"> dungeon build</a> entering stealth is a good way to condi remove and protect your party during the run. You also grant stealth to allies when you are reviving them.
		</p>	
		<br>
		<div class = "linebreak">.</div>
		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough </h3>
		<p>Story mode is fairly easy like usual, follow the event points, fight your way through nearly all the enemies in the dungeon.</p>
		
		<h4>Gossip with the nobles</h4>
		<p>Talk to the NPCs with the red mark above their heads and choose the correct response to fill the progress bar. Ask your party members to help you. NPCs will have a small cool down until you can talk to them again.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Prototype Golem</h4>
		<p>His laser attack hurts and casts burn on you, enter stealth if you have it. Avoid his rockets or his laser by breaking the line of sight using the statue in the middle of the garden. <br>
		It is highly recommended to stay range when he spins his arms and melee otherwise.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Follow the shining path</h4>
		<p>Follow the shining path into the house and kill the guard when he wakes up.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Ambush in the library</h4>
		<p>There's an ambush waiting for you  in the library. Aggro all the enemies and stack behind the door to DPS them down.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Cellar</h4>
		<p>Same tactic with the ambush in the library. Stack and aggro enemies in each section of the room. Make sure you don't aggro too many or else your party may not make it through alive.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Saving Sigfast</h4>
		<p>So the NPC got drunk and got lost in the cellar. Kil the Champion and the enemies that spawn. Stack and aggro also works in this instance, use the barrels on the dock to help you or hug the wall. After killing all the enemies, wake up Sigfast by splashing water on him so he can trundle back into the party.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Outside the cellar to the garden</h4>
		<p>There are patrols going around as you make your way through the garden. It is highly recommended to kill the Hunting Dogs first because they will cast a long Fear. Use pistol 4 to crowd control the Hunting Dogs to avoid the Fear.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Separatist Captain DeLana</h4>
		<p>Using the stack and aggro technique, stack up against the house near the garden. Make sure to kill the Elite enemies first then focus on the boss. </p><br>
		
		<h4>Dungeon Complete</h4>
		<p>Congratulations! You have completed the dungeon!</p><br>
