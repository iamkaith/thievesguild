		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough: Hodgin's Path</h3> <br>

		<h4>Defending Hodgins</h4>
		<p>This part is tragically annoying. Defend Hodgins while destroying the burrows that spawn. There are 6 burrows in total. Spliting into two groups is highly recommended to complete this section faster. The order of the borrows go:<br>
		Set 1: north, south-east, north-west<br>
		Set 2: west, south-west, north-west <br>
		Skirt around Hodgins when crossing the room so the enemies will not target him.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Gathering scepter pieces</h4>
		<p>The first one is really easy, you get it once the defend event completes. It is up the stairs and in the chest. <br>
		The other 5 pieces are in the large room filled with Gravelings to the west. Have 1 party member stay near Hodgins to interact with him immediately once all the pieces have been obtained. The rest will enter the room and pick up the scepter pieces. They are often found in the middle of a group of Gravelings. Stealth is incredibly useful here as if do properly doing the stealth rotation (smoke screen, blinding powder, shadow refuge) will grant you enough stealth in to get you around the room with all the pieces. Once you have obtained all the pieces, run to the other side of the room to safety and ask your other party member to talk to Hodgins.</p><br>
		
		<h4>To the boss room</h4>
		<p>There are going to be mobs patrolling around the area so kill whatever you can to get across to the room. In the tunnels you will have a choice to split 3-ways, any tunnel you take is fine. Kill your way through, target the Breeders first.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Howling King</h4>
		<p>If your party is packing enough DPS, burn him before he spawns his additions. If he spawns his additions, pull them to the rings of fire to instantly kill them. As usual, attack his butt and avoid his face. He's got a nasty sonic scream which will instantly down you.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Dungeon Complete</h4>
		<p>Congratulations! You have completed the dungeon! </p><br>
