		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough</h3>
		
		<h4>Escort NPC to Camp</h4>
		<p>Avoid the spike traps around the Graveling, use the coffins to stay away from the floor.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Staircase leading away from Camp</h4>
		<p>Destroy the burrow immediately below the staircase. This is optional but it helps in case any party members need to waypoint back and run down the stairs.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Trap room</h4>
		<p>There are flame jets on the pillars and spike traps on the floor. Jump over the traps by jumping off the rubble on the left or right side. Don't go down the middle.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Spider Room</h4>
		<p>Don't go down the stairs, flame jets on the walls so it will be really hard to revive you if you go downed. The spider room itself has 4 flame jets on either side of the pillars into the room and 2 on the walls. Destroy them immediately because they will help with the fight. Clear the little spider hatchlings in the room to spawn the Queen. Kill the hatchlings first before focusing on the Queen because of the strong poison attack.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Spider Queen</h4>
		<p>It is highly recommended to melee this fight, it was harder to range and avoid her AoE. Attack her butt and try to stay there as much as possible. She does a deadly poison spray in the front and does a hard-hitting bite which takes a ton of damage.</p><br>
	
		<h4>Trap hallway</h4>
		<p>Watch how the traps trigger and safely make your way across. If you make it to the end, make sure to dodge roll forward to avoid the flame jets waiting for you. There's a chain on the left to disable the traps.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Lieutenant Kholer</h4>
		<p>This fight is optional but he does spawn a chest and a waypoint if completed. He's got a deadly pull and spin attack that needs to be avoided, if he draws his arm back and his sword starts glowing dodge to avoid his pull or break the line of sight by hiding behind a pillar. His pull attack brings you close to him and then he does a deadly spin which will likely down you. He can be meleed or ranged, as usual with melee, try to stay behind him to avoid his cleave attacks. <br>
		This marks the end of the shard path, please use the links below to access the NPC specific paths.</p><br>
