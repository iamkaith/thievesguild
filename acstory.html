		<h3>Extra Notes</h3>		
		<p>
		If you happen to be using my <a href="dungeonskills.html"> dungeon build</a> entering stealth is a good way to condi remove and protect your party during the run. Stun breaks are listed above to be used for gravelings.

		<h3>Dungeon Walkthrough </h3>
		<p>Story mode is fairly easy, follow the points on the map to the locations, fight your way through and stealth if necessary and continue on.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Coffin room</h4>
		<p>Avoid the traps on the floor and open the coffins up one-by-one to kill the enemies that spawn. Keep doing so until the boss Gateguard comes up. If you still have any Ascalonian enemies and the Gateguard spawns, be sure to focus on the remaning ghosts before focusing on the Gateguard</p>
		
		<h4>Gateguard</h4>
		<p>If you prefer to keep a distance then you can range, you'll be safe from his normal attacks and launch attacks. Try to keep a distance and kite whenever you can. Make sure to keep an eye on the traps.<br>
		If you're planning on meleeing then attack his butt and dodge or stun break when he jumps into the air. The jump animation singles he is doing his special launch or knockdown attack.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Trap room</h4>
		<p>There's a chain on the left wall to disable all the traps on the floor. Focus on killing the Monk first because he hurts a ton and the Elementalist can be second.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Hallway after trap room</h4>
		<p>There are flame jets on the wall that hurts like heck so if you haven't disabled the traps yet, now would be a good time. Kill the enemies in this order: Monk, Elementalist, Warrior. </p><br>
		
		<h4>Gate on the way to spike room</h4>
		<p>The gate ahead is closed off. To open it, grab a boulder and put it on the pressure plate. In the next set of enemies try to grab the Warrior and pull him away from the Rangers, kill him off first. Then focus on the Rangers. The Rangers are deadly with their high damage, poison attacks, and annoying knock back.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Spike room</h4>
		<p>Stick to the left , don't go through the middle. You can't dodge or block these traps so wait patiently and run after the trap goes off. If you manage to make it across, quickly disable the traps by pulling on the chain at the end of the room. The chains are guarded by a ghost so you can stealth in quickly to get past him or run if you don't have any equipped<br>
		Once he's dead, pick up another boulder and put it on the next pressure plate.</p><br>
	
		<h4>Fire room</h4>
		<p>This room is filled with traps, dodge when you're running in front of the flame jet. You're going to need a ranged weapon if you want to destroy the traps. Alternatively, if you don't feel like destroying the traps, just run forward and heal when you need to.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Burrow room</h4>
		<p>Destroy the Graveling burrow, not only does it spawn enemies but you need to destroy it to open the door. You will be blocked by a group of enemies once you get past the door and into the hallway, target in this order: Elementalist, Mesmer, Warrior. Next enemy is the Captain, range is high recommended here because she hits like a ton of bricks. </p><br>

		<h4>King room</h4>
		<p>Kill enemies and Gateguard is going to show up again, try to stay behind him like you did before.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Nente</h4>
		<p>At 100% he will stay on the platform. At 75% he will teleport over and melee the group. Try to stay behind him and if Fang, his pet, is following you then keep running. At 50% he will be back on the platform and at 25% he will teleport off again.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Kasha</h4>
		<p>Avoid her AoE and she occasionally fears you, so bring your stun breaks. Otherwise just keep hitting her. If she summons any of her pets, avoid the Flesh Golem because of his annoying knock back.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Vassar and Ralena</h4>
		<p>Keep these two separated because if they get close enough, they will cast shields around themselves to knock back or reflect. Use smokescreen to keep blind on them and keep hitting them until they go down. Kill Vassar first, then kill Ralena.</p><br>
		
		<h4>King Adelbern</h4>
		<p>Keep your eyes on the ground and avoid the AoEs he cast, the damage per tick is high and you will likey get downed. Keep hitting him until he goes down. He may pull the entire group on occasion, just run back out aftewards. If you're meleeing, attack his butt as much as possible to avoid his attack combo.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Dungeon Complete</h4>
		<p>Congratulations! You have just completed the dungeon!</p><br>
